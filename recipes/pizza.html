    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This cheese pizza tastes just like what you’d expect from your classic pie, but infinitely better. 
        <br>It’s sophisticated enough for adults, but loved by all kids.
        <br> We’ve tested on multiple kids in our lives, and they’re 100% in love with this cheese pizza.</p>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>1 Ball Pizza Dough</li>
    <li>1/3 cup Pizza Sauce</li>
<li>4 ounces fresh mozzarella cheese</li>
<li>4 ounces shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
<li>1/4 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
<li>Kosher salt</li>
<li>Cornmeal for dusting</li>
<li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
</ul>
<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Make the pizza dough: Follow the Best Pizza Dough recipe to prepare the dough. (This takes about 15 minutes to make and 45 minutes to rest.)</li>
    <li>Place a pizza stone in the oven and preheat to 500°F. OR preheat your pizza oven</li>
    <li>Make the pizza sauce: Make the Easy Pizza Sauce.</li>
    <li>Prepare the toppings: Slice or tear the fresh mozzarella into small pieces.</li>
    <li>Bake the pizza: When the oven is ready, dust a pizza peel with cornmeal or semolina flour. (If you don’t have a pizza peel, you can use a rimless baking sheet or the back of a rimmed baking sheet. But a pizza peel is well worth the investment!) Stretch the dough into a circle; see How to Stretch Pizza Dough for instructions. Then gently place the dough onto the pizza peel.</li>
    <li>Spread the pizza sauce over the dough using the back of a spoon to create a thin layer. Add the pieces of fresh mozzarella cheese evenly across the dough, then top with the shredded mozzarella cheese. Sprinkle evenly with the garlic powder, dried oregano, and a few pinches of kosher salt.</li>
    <li>Use the pizza peel to carefully transfer the pizza onto the preheated pizza stone. Bake the pizza until the cheese and crust are nicely browned, about 5 to 7 minutes in the oven (or 1 minute in a pizza oven). Slice into pieces and serve immediately.</li>
